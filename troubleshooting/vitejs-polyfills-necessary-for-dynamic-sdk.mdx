## Vite.js requires global and process polyfills

If you're using Vite.js with react and using the Dynamic SDK you may get this error in your console:

```
util.js:109 Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

This is because one of the many libraries that our SDK depends on uses the `process` module which is natively not in the browser environment nor is it automatically polyfilled by Vite.

#### Polyfill `process` using `vite.config.js`

To fix this we must modify the `vite.config.js` file to modify `esbuild` to polyfill this for us. Here is a minimal example config:

```TypeScript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill";
import { NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill";

export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      // Enable esbuild polyfill plugins
      plugins: [
        NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin({
          process: true,
        }),
        NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin(),
      ],
    },
  },
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

#### Warning: You may still see a console error `React Static Flag Error`

After applying the polyfill, you may still see an error for `React Static Flag Error`. This is currently expected. To learn more, checkout the troubleshooting page [React Static Flag Error](/docs/react-static-flag-error). At this time, you can ignore this error in local development environment.
