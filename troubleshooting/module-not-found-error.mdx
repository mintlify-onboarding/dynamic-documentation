<Note>
### ðŸš§ The issue has been resolved - we no longer have Framer Motion as a dependency. \[ >0.14.x\]
</Note>

After installing the SDK you may hit an error when you try to build your React App:

```
ERROR in ./node_modules/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react/node_modules/framer-motion/dist/es/utils/process.mjs 5:17-24
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'process/browser' in 'node_modules/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react/node_modules/framer-motion/dist/es/utils'
Did you mean 'browser.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request 'process/browser' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.

ERROR in ./node_modules/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react/node_modules/framer-motion/dist/es/utils/process.mjs
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'module')
```

This is because by default Webpack requires all EcmaScript Modules to be fully specified when importing. This is likely an issue in a downstream third-party library such as framer-motion for which our SDK depends.

This is a simple fix by updating your Webpack config rules to disable [fullySpecified](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified):

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        resolve: {
          fullySpecified: false, // disable the behaviour
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
