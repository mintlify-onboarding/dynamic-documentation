## Upgrading Dynamic SDK to \>=0.14.0

If you are still running NextJS with React \<=17, installing our latest SDK will fail to load the ESM module.

This is because from 0.14.0+ we are now bundling a fully compliant hybrid ESM and CJS packages.

After installing Dynamic's package, you might see this error:

```Text
Error: Cannot find module 'nextjs-blog/node_modules/react/jsx-runtime' imported from nextjs-blog/node_modules/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react/index.js
Did you mean to import react/jsx-runtime.js?
```

This is because in React 18 they added an `exports` field to their package.json to handle mapping `react/jsx-runtime` to `react/jsx-runtime.js`

### NextJS \>=13.1 Solution

NextJS introduced a configuration option to automatically transpile ESM packages.

```TypeScript
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    transpilePackages: ['@dynamic-labs/sdk-react'],
  },
};
```

### NextJS \<13.1

Before 13.1, you need to `npm i next-transpile-modules` and update your next.config.js:

```TypeScript
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@dynamic-labs/sdk-react']);

const nextConfig = withTM({
  reactStrictMode: true,
});

module.exports = nextConfig;

```
