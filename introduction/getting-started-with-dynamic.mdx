<Warning>
### (Legacy) NextJS with React \<17
 
If you use NextJS with React 17 or below please follow the instructions, [here](/nextjs-with-react-17-with-dynamic-react-sdk-0140).

</Warning>

### Step 1: Create an account

1. [Sign up with your wallet](https://app.dynamic.xyz) to get an environment ID
2. Create an organization and a set up your first project
3. Copy your `environmentID` from the Dynamic overview page
4. (optional) [Configure your site's CORS origins](/security)

### Step 2: Install our npm package

You can install Dynamic's SDK with either `yarn` or `npm`. We currently support
React and NextJS.

```bash Shell
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react
# or yarn add @dynamic-labs/sdk-react
```

### Step 3: Configure the SDK

Copy the following snippet into your project and paste in your environmentId:

<CodeGroup>

```js JavaScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      environmentId: "<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>",
    }}
  >
    <DynamicWidget />
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```

```ts TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      appLogoUrl:
        "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Examplelogo.svg",
      appName: "Example App",
      environmentId: "Enter your Environment ID here",
    }}
  >
    <DynamicWidget />
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Log in with your wallet, and see data in your developer dashboard

Now that your widget is set up locally, try to log in. As soon as you do, head
over to your [developer dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) and click on **user
management** and **analytics**. You'll be able to see your user show up!

### Step 5: Customize your SDK design

There are many ways to customize the Dynamic modal to fit your needs (you can
explore them in the [SDK configuration](/connect-and-sign) section), but to
start, we suggest setting a light/dark mode and a primary color for the modal,
which you can do in the
[design section of your developer dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/design/modal).

### Step 6: Explore how to use our SDK

After your users connect their wallets, you'll want to interact with them for
various reasons. See the example and follow the guides to learn how our SDK
makes it easy to interact with user & wallet objects, blockchain accounts, and
more!

### Step 7: Celebrate! (and dive deeper into Dynamic)

That's it. You should now have a fully working version of the Dynamic login
flow.

Now that you have it set up, you can deep dive into our methods and objections
guidelines, play around with options in your developer dashboard, customize your
UI via the dashboard, pull user data from the API and do much more. The world is
your oyster (imagine a deep movie voice).

anything on your mind.
