### ðŸ“˜ Use SDK V0.14.12

Use Dynamic's v0.14.12+ SDK with Wagmi's v0.10.3 to leverage this guide for your Wagmi integration.
</Note>

If you're already using or would like to use Wagmi, not to worry, because Dynamic works alongside Wagmi! This page describes a setup where your users interact with the Dynamic SDK for authentication, while using Wagmi hooks to interact with your users' wallets.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the 2 steps required to use Wagmi within Dynamic:

1. Install the DynamicWagmiConnector package
2. Setup the DynamicWagmiConnector

#### 1\. Install DynamicWagmiConnector

First, you want to install the DynamicWagmiConnector package using `npm` or `yarn`

```npm
npm install @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector
```

```yarn
yarn add @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector
```

#### 2\. Import and add DynamicWagmiConnector to your App

Next you'll want to:

1. Import the DynamicWagmiConnector
2. Wrap your app with the `DynamicWagmiConnector`

```TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';

// 1. Import the DynamicWagmiConnector
import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from '@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        environmentId: '<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>',
      }}
    >
      {/* 2. Wrap your app with the `DynamicWagmiConnector` */}
      <DynamicWagmiConnector>
        <DynamicWidget />
        <YourApp />
      </DynamicWagmiConnector>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}

```

<Note>
### ðŸ“˜ A note on `WagmiConfig`

You may have noticed that the [WagmiConfig](https://wagmi.sh/react/WagmiConfig) is missing from the setup code. This is because `DynamicWagmiConnector` is in charge of rendering the `WagmiConfig` with a [Wagmi client](https://wagmi.sh/react/client). `DynamicWagmiConnector` will make sure to update the Wagmi client with the networks and RPC Providers that you've specified in the Dashboard.

For more information on managing networks in the Dashboard, [see here](/docs/chains-networks)

For more information on managing RPC Providers in the Dashboard, [see here](/docs/rpc-urls-1)
</Note>

---

That's it! Inside of the YourApp component, you can use Wagmi hooks like `useAccount`, `useNetwork` and more, like so:

```TypeScript
import { useAccount, useNetwork } from 'wagmi';

const YourApp = () => {
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();
  const { chain } = useNetwork();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        wagmi connected: {isConnected ? 'true' : 'false'}
      </p>
      <p>wagmi address: {address}</p>
      <p>wagmi network: {chain?.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Note>
### ðŸ“˜ Install Wagmi

Even though `DynamicWagmiConnector` has its own dependency on Wagmi, you will still need to install Wagmi and ethers separately in order to use Wagmi hooks. You can do this by running `npm i wagmi ethers`
</Note>

#### Next Steps

1. If you're adding networks not currently supported in our Dashboard, check out the [guide for adding custom networks](/docs/network-switching). Any networks added will be available through the Wagmi hooks.
2. For more information on what you can do with Wagmi, check out their docs: [https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started)
