To upgrade, ensure you are using v0.15 or later of `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react`
(see the [release notes](/changelog/v0150) on upgrading to v0.15). Once set up,
visit your Dynamic developer dashboard and head to the
[integrations page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/integrations). Select the
WalletConnect card, add your `WalletConnect project ID` (you can create one by
visiting [WalletConnect's dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in))
and toggle v2 on.

Once enabled, Dynamic will automatically use WalletConnect v2 for wallets that
support it, and v1 for wallets that donâ€™t.
