### Summary

Onboarding new users to web3 can be a daunting task, especially for users who are not familiar with wallets. That is why we are enabling email sign up with an invisible wallet in the background. This significantly reduces the friction associated with the process!

At Dynamic, we are partnering with best in class solutions to support this use case with more options coming in the future.

To enable this functionality on your website, all you need to do is add your credentials and turn on a toggle.
