title: "Custom Sign Message"
---

We currently send the following message when asking a user to sign their wallet
when authenticating:

> Welcome to \{\{your app name\}\}. Signing is the only way we can truly know
> that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe,
> gas-less transaction that does not in any way give \{\{your app name\}\}
> permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.

<Note>Note: We base the default message on the standard SIWE format.</Note>

If you would like to update this message and customize it for your users, you
simply need to update this message by passing in the prop `siweStatement` and
your custom message:

```ts TypeScript
<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    environmentId: "<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>",
    appName: "<<projectName>>",
    appLogoUrl: "..."
    siweStatement: "Your custom message goes here....",

    ...
  }}
>
```
