title: "Sort and Filter Wallets"

### Summary

There are a few helper methods you can leverage to sort, filter, remove, or filter and sort wallets. You can call the methods from within the `walletsFilter` prop. 

The helper methods are:

1. FilterWallets
2. RemoveWallets
3. SortWallets
4. FilterAndSortWallets
5. BYOF (Bring your own function)

### Setup

#### walletsFilter (optional)

To filter and sort wallets, you'll want to use the `walletsFilter` prop under settings. You will then use either the one of the helper methods or BYOF to organize your wallet list.

```TypeScript 
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget, FilterWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';
....
 <DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: //select the function you want to use to filter and/or sort.
    }
  }}
> 
```

### Usage

#### FilterWallets

If you would like to filter out all wallets except for a predefined list, then call the FilterWallets method and include the wallets that you want your users to use:


```TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget, FilterWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';
....
 <DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: FilterWallets(['wallet1', 'wallet2', 'wallet3', 'wallet4']);
    }
  }}
> 
```

#### SortWallets

The Dynamic SDK has a predefined sorted list of wallets. If you want to change the wallet list to a different ordered list, add a sorted array of the wallets that you want to appear first.  
The rest of the wallets will keep their current order.

TypeScript

```TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget, SortWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';
....
 <DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: SortWallets(['wallet1', 'wallet2', 'wallet3', 'wallet4']);
    }
  }}
> 
```

#### FilterAndSortWallets

If you would like to combine the previous two options, then you can use the FilterAndSortWallets method to define the wallets that you want to appear in a specific order.

```TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget, FilterAndSortWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';
....
 <DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: FilterAndSortWallets(['wallet1', 'wallet2', 'wallet3', 'wallet4']);
    }
  }}
> 
```

#### RemoveWallets

If you want to remove specific wallets from the available list of wallets, you can call the RemoveWallets and specify which wallets you don't want your users to use:

```TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget, RemoveWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';
....
 <DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: RemoveWallets(['wallet1', 'wallet2', 'wallet3', 'wallet4']);
    }
  }}
> 
```

#### BYOF (Bring Your Own Function)

If the above helper methods are not sufficient, you can design your own function and pass it to walletFilter.

```TypeScript
<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    ...
    walletsFilter: (wallets) =>  {
      return wallets.filter((wallet) => {
        return ['wallet1', 'wallet2'].includes(wallet.key)
      });
    },
  }}
>

```

#### Fetch standardized wallet keys

To find the key of all the wallets you can output all the keys using the following syntax:

```TypeScript
import { useDynamicContext } from ‘@dynamic-labs/sdk-react’;

const { wallets } = useDynamicContext();
console.log(wallets.map((wallet) => wallet.key));         
```
