title: "Sandbox vs Live"
description:
  "Every project you create in Dynamic comes with a Sandbox and a Live
  environment. Both these environments behave similarly but we've customized the
  Sandbox environment to make it ideal for testing and exploring features."

<Note>
### ðŸ“˜ Sandbox should only be used for testing

Sandbox user limits are rolling out soon, and we wanted to give you a heads up.
Please make sure you're using your live environments in production.

</Note>

### Key Differences

1. **Everything is free**: all Dynamic features on Sandbox are free. Whether you
   choose to upgrade to our Advanced tier or not, all the features that we offer
   will be available for you to test and explore.
2. **Sandbox is limited to 100 users**: your Sandbox environment is intended to
   help you test configurations and features and is not intended to be live on
   your site. We therefore have limited Sandbox to 100 users. After 100 users,
   you will not be able to authenticate new wallets unless you delete users.
3. **You can delete users in Sandbox** : having to make new wallets to test an
   onboarding for first time users is tedious and, frankly, annoying. We don't
   like it and we figure that you won't either. While it's not best practices to
   delete live customers, in Sandbox, you can simply hit the Trash icon in your
   user management table and delete users in your Dashboard. It's a simple click
   and will allow you test more easily test your wallets and replicate the first
   time user experience.
