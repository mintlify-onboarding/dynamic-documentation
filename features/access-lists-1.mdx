#### Add your Access List

If you're launching a new site, then access lists or waitlists are probably a high priority for you. In the [Configurations page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) of your developer dashboard, click on the Access list card.

Here you can create access lists based on wallet addresses. 

1. Simply click "Create New List"
2. Set a name for your list
3. Add the addresses you want to give access to and an optional alias field to keep track of these addresses
4. Enable the toggle when you're ready.
5. Boom. You're done.

You can create multiple lists to help keep track of different groups of users (ie, VIPs, beta users, internal users, etc). Note: a user only needs to be in one of the lists to pass. 

Once enabled, if a user is not on your access list then they will be blocked from entering your site.

**Customize the copy**

You can customize the copy through props in our SDK but update the `accessDeniedMessagePrimary` and `accessDeniedMessageSecondary`.

```TypeScript
<DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{....  
accessDeniedMessagePrimary: 'Your copy1',
        accessDeniedMessageSecondary: 'Your Copy2',
      }}
```
