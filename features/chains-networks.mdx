### Configure supported Chains and Networks

In your developer dashboard, you can toggle on the chains that you currently
support. Whether it is Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism or other EVM based chains or
Solana and Flow. Simple save the settings, and refresh your page with the SDK.
You're good to go.

Simply go to the
[configurations page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) in your
dashboard and flip the toggle. We currently support the following chains:

1. EVM: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Palm, Aurora, BNB Smart Chain
2. Solana
3. Flow
4. Algorand
5. StarkNet

#### Custom EVM Chains

If you want to specify networks not listed above, you can manually define your
network in the SDK props. See the guide [here](/network-switching).
