  "This page hosts the keys that you'll need to setup the SDK, validate the JWT,
  and generate tokens for API usage."

To access this page, navigate to the
[developer's](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer) page in your
dashboard.

#### Environment ID

The environment ID is the key used for our platform to identify your SDK and
associate the users to your project environment. Each project has 2 keys, one
for Sandbox and one for Live. Whenever you want to setup a new instance of the
SDK, you simply need to copy the Environment ID and copy it into the settings
prop in the SDK.

```ts TypeScript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      environmentId: "Enter your Environment ID here",
    }}
  >
    <DynamicWidget />
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```

#### Public Key

The public key is what you can use to validate the JWT is authentic on your
backend. We recommend that you follow
[this guide](/how-to-validate-users-on-the-backend) to properly validate your
users and ensure that users are using authenticated JWT's.

#### API Tokens

To use our API's, all you'll need to do is create a token and use it in your API
requests as a bearer Token. You can test out our API's
[here](/reference/getenvironmentbyid-1).
