  "We take security seriously at Dynamic and most of the work we do is behind
  the scenes so you don't have to worry about it. We will surface some security
  features that can be configured. "

Today, we have 2 features that you can configure

1. CORS origin urls
2. JWT expiration time

### Allowed CORS Origin

Adding origins for
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to your project
environment (sandbox and live) protects your environment from unauthorized
websites using your public environment key.

Any origins added to an environment will allow only those domains to make API
requests via our SDK.

#### Adding an Origin

To add an origin, navigate to **Settings > Security** in the dashboard.

Click **Create Origin** and add your origin. (You can add multiple origins to
any environment)

Be sure to format your origin according to the RFC 6545 format (exception of the
wildcard `*`). An origin is a URL without the path.

#### Using wildcards

One or more `*` wildcard characters in your origin will represent 0 or more
characters (a-z, 0-9, -, .) when matching origins.

#### Acceptable Example Values

- [http://domain.com](http://domain.com)
- [https://domain.com](https://domain.com)
- [https://sub.domain.com](https://sub.domain.com)
- [http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200)
- [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200)
- [https://my-app-\*.vercel.app](https://my-app-%2A.vercel.app)

#### Unacceptable Example Values

- domain.com
- //domain.com
- [https://domain.com/home](https://domain.com/home)

### JWT Expiration Time

In the security settings page, you can update the expiration date of the JWT
token. The expiration time is the amount of time before one of your customers
will need to sign to log in.

To update this expiration time, navigate to **Settings > Security** in the
dashboard. Enter the amount of time in Day, Weeks, Months for the expiration
time.

IMAGE NEEDED ONCE THIS GOES LIVE

The default value that we have set is 2 hours. We recommend that you verify with
a security expert or your security team before updating this value.
