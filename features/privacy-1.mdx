#### Configure IP collection

Keeping privacy in mind is central to how we design and build our systems. We realize that some companies prefer to collect as little data as possible about their users while others would prefer to collect a little bit more. 

That's why, in our effort to minimize information collected about users where possible have the option to collect or not to collect IP addresses. By default, IP logging is off for logged in users. If you need to enable IP collection for compliance or other reasons, you can toggle this option on in the [Privacy page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/settings/privacy) of your dashboard.

As we build out more features, additional configurations will be placed here so you have control about what is or is not collected.
