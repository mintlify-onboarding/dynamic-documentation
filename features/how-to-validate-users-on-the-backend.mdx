When an end user connects their wallet, you, the developer, get a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction) that can be used to verify some claims about the end user, notably a proof of ownership over a wallet public address.

Upon authentication, we generate a JWT signed with a private key (using RS256 algorithm) that is unique to you. In turn, you can use the associated public key (found in the [API tab](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/api) of your developer dashboard) to ensure that the token is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. In other words, if a JWT issued by Dynamic can be successfully verified with your public key, the information it contains can be trusted.

You can do this in multiple ways.

#### Option 1: Leverage [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org)

We offer an official [passport-dynamic](https://github.com/dynamic-labs/passport-dynamic) extension.

#### Option 2: Do-It-Yourself Verification

1. Install the [node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) package
2. Obtain your public key from Dynamic's API dashboard or through our [/keys](https://app.dynamic.xyz/api-docs/#/Environments/getKeysForEnvironment) API endpoint.
3. Get the JWT through the Dynamic SDK with [authToken](/docs/methods-objects#usedynamiccontext).
4. Send the authToken to the server as a Bearer token

```JavaScript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export const useFetch = (authToken: string | null) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchApi = async () => {
      await fetch("http://localhost:9000/api", {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
        },
      }).then(response => response.json()).then(setData);
    }
  
    fetchApi()
  }, [authToken]);

  return { data };
};
```

5. Verify the JWT on your server with the [node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) package

```JavaScript
var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

jwt.verify(token, publicKey, function(err, decodedToken) {
  console.log(decodedToken)
});
```
