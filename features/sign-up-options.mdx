### Summary

When it comes to onboarding user, having a flexible sign-up flow that can accommodate different preferences is key. Whether users prefer to sign up with their email, social media accounts, or directly with a wallet, providing the options that fit your user's needs can make the onboarding process smoother, more user-friendly, and increase conversion. 

That is why we are offering the flexibility to design the sign up screen to suit your needs. You can now choose whether you want users to sign up with their email, social accounts _(coming soon)_, or with wallets. You can configure this as needed.

### Usage

To configure the sign up flow:

1. Go to the [configurations page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) in your developer dashboard
2. Click on the Sign up with Email _(social is coming soon)_ card
3. Select if you want to enable Sign up with email  
   1. If you want to enable Email sign up with invisible wallets, see [here](/docs/invisible-wallets).
4. Select the priority of email relative to wallets (ie, do you want email to be above wallet selection)
