In our New to Web3 help section in our SDK, we show a common wallet for users to get started for each chain. For now, if you have enabled more than 1 chain, then we will show only 1 chain and 1 wallet.

To change the default wallet shown in this this section, you can pass a prop `newToWeb3WallChainMap` to specify the primary chain (this is to support multi-chain) and then specify the wallet with the corresponding chain.

```Typescript
<DynamicContextProvider
   settings={{
      environmentId: "1234abcd-1234-abcd-1234-abcd12343abc",
      appName: "My Cool App",
      appLogoUrl: "..."
      apiBaseUrl: "https://app.dynamic.xyz/api/v0",
      newToWeb3WalletChainMap: {
         primary_chain: 'flow', // <-- Here you specify the primary chain which will select the wallet to show
         wallets: { // <-- With "wallets" you specify the wallets you want to show for each chain
           flow: 'blocto',
           solana: 'glow'
         },
      },
   }}>
   <HomePage />
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

For customers supporting multiple chains, you can also specify which chain you prefer to be primary which will then recommend the wallet aligned with that chain. You **don't** need to specify a wallet unless you want to override the current default wallet for that chain.

```TypeScript 
<DynamicContextProvider  
   settings={{  
     apiBaseUrl: {your api base url},  
     appLogoUrl: {your app logo url},  
     appName: {your app name},  
     environmentId: {your environment id},  
     newToWeb3WalletChainMap: {  
          primary_chain: 'flow',  
          wallets: {} 
       },  
     },  
   }}>  
   <HomePage />  
</DynamicContextProvider>
```
