Just note that organizations are **billed** separately.

In the navigation bar, click on the Organization dropdown menu and:

1. Click "Create new organization"
2. Enter Organization Name and Project Name

And you're done. You now have a new organization that you can use. You will need
to invite members of your team to this organization if you would like to work
with them on this organization.
