| App Logo Url                                   | Whenever we display an app logo url, then we'll use this url.                                                                                                                      |
| Image when user is not found in an Access list | If you use an access list, and want a friendly image in the SDK (think a success image), then you can add an image url that we'll display                                          |
| Image when user is on an Access list           | If you use an access list, and want a friendly image in the SDK (think a friendly image to show that a user doesn't have access), then you can add an image url that we'll display |
| Support URL                                    | Whenever a user may be stuck, we'll show your support url to customers so they can reach out.                                                                                      |
