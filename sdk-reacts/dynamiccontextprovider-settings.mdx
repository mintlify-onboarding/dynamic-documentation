| onboardingImageUrl?: string;                                     | When provided, this image will be shown during the customer information capture step after a wallet successfully authenticates with Dynamic and the environment requires additional information from the user.                                                                                            |
| policiesConsentInnerComponent?: ReactNode \| ReactNode\[\];      | For environments with the username setting enabled, you will need to pass in a value for this prop to show a custom prompt or label for the policies contest checkboxes displayed during customer information capture after signing.                                                                      |
| privacyPolicyUrl?: string;                                       | When provided, this will display a privacy policy URL on the signing step.

| shadowDOMEnabled?: boolean;                                      | Shadow DOM allows the SDK to look as intended wherever it is hosted and it plays nicely with your existing styling system.

| termsOfServiceUrl?: string;                                      | When provided, this will display a terms of service URL on the signing step. This should be set to a URL of your organization’s terms of service web page.                                                                                                                                                |
| walletsFilter?: (options: WalletOption\[\]) => WalletOption\[\]; | When specified, this is a custom function that allows clients of Dynamic SDK to filter out wallet options based on a function on the wallet options. For example: walletsFilter: (wallets) => wallets.filter((w) => w.key !== 'walletx') will exclude walletx from showing up on the wallet list.         |

## Examples

#### Initiate Dynamic using only defaults

```JavaScript  
<DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      environmentId: '<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>'
  }}>
  <MyChildComponents /> 
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

#### Do not show `walletx` on the wallet list

```JavaScript
<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    environmentId: '<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>'
    walletsFilter: (wallets) => wallets.filter((w) => w.key !== 'walletx'),
  }}
>
  <MyChildComponents /> 
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

#### With events callbacks

```JavaScript
<DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      environmentId: '<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>',
          eventsCallbacks: {
        onAuthFlowClose: () => {
          console.log('in onAuthFlowClose');
        },
        onAuthFlowOpen: () => {
          console.log('in onAuthFlowOpen');
        },
        onAuthSuccess: () => {
          navigate('/dashboard/overview');
        },
        onLogout: () => {
          console.log('in onLogout');
        },
      },
  }}>
  <MyChildComponents /> 
</DynamicContextProvider>
```
