### Summary

A hook with utility functions to sign with a specific wallet. 

The hook needs to be initialized within a child of `DynamicContextProvier`

#### `openWallet` \- available from version `v0.14.32`

Initiates the signing process for a specific wallet without opening the dynamic auth flow. 

For example, you can create a button that will sign the user with MetaMask specifically.

```TypeScript
const SignWithMetaMaskButton = () => {
  const { openWallet } = useWalletItemActions();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => openWallet('metamask')}>
      Sign with MetaMask
    </button>
  )
}
```
