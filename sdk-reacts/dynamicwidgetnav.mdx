title: "DynamicNav"

### Summary

The DynamicNav component is responsible for rendering the network picker and the connected account field.

Typically, if you want to use the DynamicNav, we recommend using the DynamicWidget since it's connected to the DynamicUserProfile.

<Note>
### ðŸš§ A duplicate widget is displayed.

Make sure you do not render `DynamicWidget` along with `DynamicNav`. These components should not be used together.
</Note>

### Usage

```JavaScript
import React from "react";
import {
  useDynamicContext,
  DynamicNav
} from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

export const AppNavigation = () => {
  const { user } = useDynamicContext();
  return (
    <nav className="nav">
        <a className="nav__element" href="/">Home</a>
        {
            user && (
                <div className="nav_element">
                <DynamicNav />
            </div>
            )
        }
    </nav>
  );
};
```
