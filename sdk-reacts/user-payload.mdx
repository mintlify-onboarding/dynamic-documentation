### ðŸ“˜ The JWT Update

The fields below are going to be released in mid-September. See below for the current, but soon to be deprecated, fields.
</Note>

When an end user connects their wallet, you, the developer, get a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction) that can be used to verify some claims about the end user, notably a proof of ownership over a wallet public address.

After authenticating the JWT token, see [Server-side verification](/v2.0/docs/how-to-validate-users-on-the-backend), you may want to leverage user and wallet information provided in the JWT. Below we have the content defined with the aim of following the JWT standards.

##### Standard JWT claims:
