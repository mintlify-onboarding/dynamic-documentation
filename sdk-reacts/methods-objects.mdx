## Components

[**DynamicContextProvier settings**](/docs/dynamiccontextprovider-settings):
Settings available when you first initialize `DynamicContextProvider` in your
App.

## Hooks

**[useDynamicContext](/docs/usedynamiccontext)**: Dynamic's React Context which
is initially set via `DynamicContextProvier`

[**useWalletItemActions**](/docs/usewalletitemactions): Set of utility functions
to sign with a specific wallet.

## Models

[**WalletConnector**](/docs/walletconnector): This is Dynamic's abstraction over
the wallet interface. This can be used to interact with the users wallet.

**[UserProfile](/docs/userprofile)**: An object containing attributes about the
user such as the wallet address, email, first name, etc.

[**Wallet**](/docs/wallet): An object containing the attributes about the
connected wallet. This object would be available immediately after a wallet has
been connected.

[**Example**](/docs/example): An example of how to setup
`DynamicContextProvider` with the appropriate settings, and then using the
`walletConnector.getWeb3Provider` method to get the balance of the user's
wallet.
