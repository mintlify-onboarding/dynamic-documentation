## Introduction

Dynamic provides a robust API that allows developers to securely access their
dashboard environment's data and programmatically update settings relevant to
their Dynamic-powered application.

## Authentication

All APIs in this section require a bearer token used to authenticate requests
and make sure the caller is authorized to access the resources in the requests.

Please follow these steps:

#### Get an API token from Dashboard

1. Go to the your environment's dashboard
   [Developer Tab](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer)
2. In the "API Token" section, click on "Create Token"
3. Provide a name for the token. The best practice here would be to name the
   token after the system you intend to use this token with. A few examples:
   "Mycompany Admin", "Ben's personal token", or "background-job service".
4. **Make sure to copy the API token** before closing the modal. This is the
   last time you will have access to the plaintext API token! Dynamic DOES NOT
   have access to the plaintext API token anywhere. If you lose this API token,
   you will need to create a new one.
5. The token should start with the prefix `dyn_` followed by 56 alphanumeric
   characters.

#### Using the API token

Use the token generated through dashboard to programmatically access Dynamic's
API by adding it to the `Authentication` header of your HTTP request.

Example:

```bash curl
curl \
--location 'https://app.dynamic.xyz/api/v0/environments/<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ADD_YOUR_DYN_TOKEN_HERE'
```

## Standard errors

- `400` \- Bad Request. The form of the request is invalid. Please check that
  the path parameters, query parameters, or the request's body contains the
  correct and expected information defined in our docs.
- `401`\- Unauthorized. The endpoint that is being accessed requires an
  `Authorization` header.
- `403` \- Forbidden. The token authorized for the HTTP call does not have
  access to the resource defined by the endpoint (eg. the specific environment,
  allowlist, user, etc.)
- `404` \- Not found. The path of the requested resource could not be found.
  Please check that the URL path is correct or that the ID provided is correct.
